# discount-alert-bot

`discount-alert-bot` is a Telegram chatbot that notifies users about discounts on products from their wish lists. Users can add product links and set a desired percentage price drop for notifications. The bot periodically checks the prices and sends alerts when discounts meet the userâ€™s criteria.

## Features

- Add Products: Users can add product links to their wish list directly through the chatbot.
- Set Price Drop Alerts: Specify the percentage decrease in price at which you want to be notified.
- Automatic Price Checking: The bot checks prices daily at 12:00 PM.
- Notifications: Receive Telegram messages when your desired products go on sale.
- Manage Wish List: Remove products or adjust alert thresholds at any time.

## Architecture Overview

The project consists of two main services:
1. `bot-interface`: Handles user interactions via Telegram and communicates with `bot-engine` through API calls and message queues.
2. `bot-engine`: Processes tasks such as parsing product pages and checking for price drops. It interacts with the PostgreSQL database and uses Celery for task scheduling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- Telegram account to interact with the bot
- API keys for OpenAI and Telegram Bot API
